# horiseon-home-challenge

Weis, Aaron

HTML and CSS challenge week one refactoring code for the Horiseon website home page

added a title to the webpage

added alt-descriptions to all existing images

added surrounding semantic html elements to navigate developer tools easier ("div" to "header", "nav", "main", "aside", and "footer")

added comments to html to better layout each section

added comments to css to make finding section styles faster

rearranged parts of the css to better follow the order of the html (header >> content >> side bar >> footer)

changed footer "h2" in html and css to "h4" to allow heading attributes to fall in sequential order

changed "div" for the navigational links into "nav"

changed the css ".header div" sections to new corresponding ".header nav" sections
