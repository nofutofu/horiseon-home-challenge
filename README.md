<h2>View Webpage</h2>

https://nofutofu.github.io/horiseon-home-challenge/


<h2>Change Log</h2>


added a title to the webpage

added alt-descriptions to all existing images

added surrounding semantic html elements to navigate developer tools easier ("div" to "header", "nav", "main", "aside", and "footer")

added comments to html to better layout each section

added comments to css to make finding section styles faster

rearranged parts of the css to better follow the order of the html (header >> content >> side bar >> footer)

changed footer "h2" in html and css to "h4" to allow heading attributes to fall in sequential order

changed "div" for the navigational links into "nav"

changed the css ".header div" sections to new corresponding ".header nav" sections

compressed sections of the css that were performing the same function into one block
(content image styling, content header styling, and sidebar styling)
